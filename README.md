Why Two Pointer?

Fast: O(n) time
Memory efficient: O(1) space
Clean: No complex shifting

Complexity
Time Complexity: O(n)

Single loop through the array
Each element visited exactly once

Space Complexity: O(1)

Only using two integer variables (read and write pointers)
No extra arrays or data structures needed
